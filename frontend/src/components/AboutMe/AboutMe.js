                    I am deeply appasionate for computers and how do they work to run stuff, so that is why I took myself to this career, challenging myself everyday to learn something new
                    professionally and personally.<br/> <br/>

                        I made this website because I wanted to challange myself with JavaScript and it's frameworks, and CSS, since I haven't used before JavaScript and CSS.
                        Also I like having a website where I can promote myself and my work. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        For this website, I am using ReactJS in the front-end, Express for the back-end and MongoDB for the database.
